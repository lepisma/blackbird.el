Lyrics reader for Emacs. Works by querying a list of now-playing functions
(~read-lyrics-getters~) which are supposed to return a ~cons~ cell of ~artist~ and
~title~.

By default, there is an interactive function added in the list. For adding your
own /now-playing/ source, do something like the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun my-now-playing ()
  "Return a cons cell containing artist and title,
or nil if no song is getting played"
  '("foo-artist" . "bar-title"))

;; Add to highest priority (or fiddle around with read-lyrics-getters list)
(add-to-list 'read-lyrics-getters #'my-now-playing)
#+END_SRC

Call ~read-lyrics~ for using the now-playing functions in sequence. For forced
manual input, use ~read-lyrics-interactive~.
